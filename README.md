Who Knows Me? 🎮

A social party game to get closer to your friends — available on web and mobile.

📖 Overview

Who Knows Me? is a social game inspired by Jackbox-style party games where players answer fun personal questions and try to guess each other’s answers. The goal is to create real conversation and laughter while learning more about your friends. Each player joins a virtual room using their phone or computer, answers questions, and competes to see who knows everyone best.

This project is built for our class assignment to develop a social app that connects people in an interactive way.
